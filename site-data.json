This\nmeans it is very full featured indeed.</li>\n<li>Templates are precompiled (one time, on the server) as JavaScript functions. There is no JavaScript runtime penalty of compiling templates.</li>\n<li>Templates are <b>not</b> stored in your HTML. No silly tricks, like putting template code in hidden textareas.</li>\n<li>A browser downloads your templates once and caches them. Just like any other JavaScript code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This site is generated entirely by Jemplate.
