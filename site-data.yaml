about_jemplate: |
  <p>JavaScript Templating is the best way to turn AJAX/JSON data into
  HTML. <b>Jemplate</b> is the best way to do JavaScript Templating.</p>

  <p><b>Jemplate</b> beats other JavaScript Templating frameworks hands
  down for the following reasons:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Jemplate is a complete port of the popular <a
  href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> framework. This
  means it is very full featured indeed.</li>
  <li>Templates are precompiled (one time, on the server) as JavaScript functions. There is no JavaScript runtime penalty of compiling templates.</li>
  <li>Templates are <b>not</b> stored in your HTML. No silly tricks, like putting template code in hidden textareas.</li>
  <li>A browser downloads your templates once and caches them. Just like any other JavaScript code.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This site is generated entirely by Jemplate. View Source to see for yourself.</p>

    story: |
      Robert Krimen stepped up and largely overhauled Jemplate. It now
      has builtin jQuery and YUI support. Ingy added a standalone
      Jemplate compiler which means you don't need to install any Perl
      modules to use Jemplate, now.

      <a href="http://www.openjsan.org">JSAN</a>. This release has many bug
      fixes, allows template names to have paths, and has many more command
      line options, including --runtime, which writes out the Jemplate runtime
      module. Thanks to all who helped out!

    title: A Touch of Jemplate
    story: |
      <i>David Coffey</i> has created a site called
      <a href="http://atouchofglasss.com/">A Touch of Glass</a> that is
      done completely with Jemplate. This site used data exported from a
      Yahoo! Store site as XML. He converted the XML to JSON and rendered
      the whole schmear with Jemplate. Simply Brilliant.
